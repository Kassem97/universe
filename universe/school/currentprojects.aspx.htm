                                                <h1>School Sports in Bosnia,Maceonia, Armenia and Georgia</h1>
                                                    <p>During autumn 2005 our office in Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated a number of “Leisure Time Fun Football” activities in cooperation with elementary schools. The programme included six schools with 50 children each i.e. boys and girls between 7 and 12 years who were supervised and trained by experienced leaders and coaches twice weekly.</p>
                                                        <p>In Macedonia a “Fun School Sport Program”, exclusively funded by the Norwegian Government, has been established in cooperation with the National School Sports Organisation. The objective is to make our “Fun-Concept” part of the daily curriculum in all primary schools in 4 selected municipalities.</p>
                                                            <p>Also in Georgia and Armenia Open Fun Football Schools branch offices have initiated an extensive school sport programme involving elementary as well as secondary schools.</p>
                                                                <p>Beside the Fun School Sport Program in Macedonia, all activities are organised by teachers who have joined the Open Fun Football Schools and who are using equipment from our operation.</p>
                                                                    <p>This being said, a more systematic approach to the schools sports platform remains to be developed.</p>
                                                                    </div>
