                                                    <p>Open Fun Football Schools is recognised as official UEFA charity partner. By that the program gets invaluable political and moral support from which we benefit in our daily contact with the National Football Associations and the local football clubs. Further we also achieve technical development support by participation in the UEFA Grassroots Conferences and we of course also receive substantial financial support.</p>
                                                        <p>

                                                        <p>Likewise, we have succeeded in building a joined Nordic donor platform. As an implementing partner of the Nordic development programs we are obliged to pursue their political goals: To simulate the development of an active and peaceful civil society. In addition to long term funding and political objectives we also seek a constructive dialogue on important issues including the one of sustainability â€“ a dialogue we consider a driving force within the project and its management.
