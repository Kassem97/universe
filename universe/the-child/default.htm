    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Promoting Grassroots Football:</strong> Our core objective is to promote children’s grassroots football through our unique “Fun Football Concept,” underpinned by the principles of “Sport for All.” This approach ensures that every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from playing football.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity for All Children:</strong> We are committed to providing opportunities for all children to “live football.” This means ensuring that every child, irrespective of gender, talent, social, political, or religious differences, can participate in football within a supportive and friendly environment, guided by responsible adults.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Gender Equality:</strong> A key objective is to promote gender equality within sports. We strive to create an environment where boys and girls have equal opportunities to participate, compete, and excel in football.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h1>Strategy</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expanding Participation:</strong> Our strategy focuses on involving as many children as possible in our Open Fun Football Schools. By 2027, our goal is to reach 1 million children across various communities, breaking down barriers and fostering a love for the sport.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Welcoming Newcomers:</strong> We aim to ensure that at least 50% of the participants in our Open Fun Football Schools are children who are not yet members of a local football club. This strategy is designed to create an inclusive atmosphere where new players can experience the joy of football without any prior involvement in formal clubs.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Achieving Gender Balance:</strong> A minimum of 50% of participants at each Open Fun Football School will be girls, reflecting our strong commitment to gender equality. This balance is crucial not only for promoting inclusivity but also for challenging traditional gender roles within sports..</li>
    </ul>
