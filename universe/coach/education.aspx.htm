                                                    <p>We organize three types of regional seminars. The common denominator of all our seminars is the specific focus of attention: We put the children first; secondly, it is our thesis that it is the environment that connects children with the game and the clubs:</p>

The coaches are introduced to the underlying values and ideas of the Open Fun Football Schools and receive training in a wide range of exercises, the focus of which is the fun elements of the game.</li>

They are the ones making all the necessary local arrangements, recruitment of coaches and children and organising the school. They go through the same education as the one of the coaches plus two additional days the main topic of which are “How to create a good children environment”.</li>

They are our link to the societies and, as such, the Open Fun Football Schools’ ambassadors within the local communities. The instructors are trained to conduct the training at leader- and coach seminars (“train –the-trainers”). Also, they are tasked to monitor the football schools and give feed back to all leaders and coaches in order to secure and develop the quality of our operation.</li>
