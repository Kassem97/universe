                                                    <p>During the past years we have witnessed a substantial increase in grassroots football activities in all the countries, we are involved in. Correspondingly, the challenge today is to encourage a viable and sustainable local grassroots structure within the framework of the National Football Associations.</p>
                                                        <p>

                                                        <p>The Senior Leaders Follow-up Education is a follow up education that was organised by Cross Cultures in cooperation with the Football Association of Norway and the Danish Sports Federation (DIF). The Follow-up Education is targeting three key persons in the various countries. One is appointed by the National FA and the remaining two by CCPA.</p>

                                                            <p>The objective is to provide the key persons with a theoretical and practical knowledge of how to run a project that will help promote building viable and sustainable grassroots football structures. Building on the participantsâ€™ background, knowledge and network, the training is tailored to develop individual vocational and leadership qualification.</p>
